# Active-Directory-Project

THIS PROJECT WAS DONE IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT USING VIRTUALBOX

This project helped to revise my memory in System Administration. Also, I was able to configure Splunk Server and use Splunk Universal Forwarder to get activity data from the AD Server and the Windows 10 workstation.
